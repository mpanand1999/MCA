“When you change your thoughts, remember to also change your world.”“We cannot solve problems with the kind of thinking we employed when we came up with them.” 
“Learn as if you will live forever, live like you will die tomorrow.” 
“Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do that, but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.”
